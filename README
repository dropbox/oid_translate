oid\_translate
==============

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a light wrapper around a C library (netsnmp) to allow quick
translations between OID and MIB Names in Python.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

New versions will be updated to PyPI pretty regularly so it should be as
easy as:

::

    pip install oid_translate
